    "1. Identify the misspelled word: Check if the word exists in the vocabulary.\n",
    "2. Find strings in n edit distance away (candidates): Exhaustively generate all the words by applying at most n operations.\n",
    "3. Filter the candidates: Find the candidates in the vocabulary.\n",
    "4. Calculate word probabilities of the remaining candidates: Pick the most frequent candidate.\n",

    "We will use dynamic programming to find minimum edit distance between two words. Dynamic programming builds on optimal solutions for smaller problems to solve the larger problem. For minimum edit distance, we consider the minimum edit distance between the subwords and find the optimal solution starting from the empty string. More concretely, we place the words to rows and columns of a table by mapping each letter to a row/column and adding empty string. Then, we compute the optimal solutions. \n",

We will fill out the distance matrix *D* such that the element D(2,3) refers to the minimum edit distance from *pl* to *sta*. In order to fill out this matrix we will perform the followinf steps:\n",

    "1. Fill out the first column: play -> # : Transform play into empty string, i.e. delete each letter\n",
    "2. Fill out the first row: # -> stay : Transform empty string into stay, i.e. insert each letter\n",
    "3. For the rest of the matrix:\n",

    "    2. If you come from the left cell; perform insert operation, as in the first row.\n",
    "    3. If you come from the upper left cell; if letters do not match perform replace operation, otherwise perform nothing.\n",
